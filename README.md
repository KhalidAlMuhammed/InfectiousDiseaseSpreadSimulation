# Infectious Disease Spread Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates the outbreak of an infectious disease, such as Covid-19, using a simplified model based on epidemiological principles. The simulation operates on a 150x150 grid map of New York City, where each cell represents a population that can be in one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), or resistant (R).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- I recommend using VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, or repl.it to run this simulation.

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine and ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhalidAlMuhammed/InfectiousDiseaseSpreadSimulation.git
cd InfectiousDiseaseSpreadSimulation
pip install matplotlib numpy
